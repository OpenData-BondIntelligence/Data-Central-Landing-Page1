		<h1 style="color: #272727; text-align: center;">Our Mission</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong style="color: #272727;">We are on a mission to optimize fixed-income trading.</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Story</h1>
<p>After working for over a decade in a few of the world’s largest financial institutions such as Bank of America, American Express (brokerage), Goldman Sachs, and a few stints at startups, Ajit began to realize how far behind the fixed income market was in adopting modern technology. Ajit started brainstorming with longtime friends from the industry and quickly zeroed in on the lack of high-quality research and expensive trading as the biggest problem. The fixed-income market is complex, inefficient, and opaque. It remains spreadsheet-driven and dominated by over-the-counter trades. The inefficiency and anomalies in the market are due to the lack of an integrated system, lack of predictive analytics, and the lack of optimized trade-matching, which ultimately lowers the trust.</p>
<p>The idea to integrate fixed income data and research was seeded. It was the one idea that would keep Ajit awake at night. It would not leave him alone, and the startup was born as OpenData to facilitate data consolidation and research. Ajit incorporated DataCentral and got the idea supported by Microsoft for startups, Microsoft Research, and Google for startups. Ajit and his team took OpenData from its inception to a revenue-generating state.</p>
<p>Ajit realized that the real impact of technology would be on the trades in the secondary market on Wall Street. Now Ajit needed more resources for Big Data and Machine Learning, which lead him to reach out and partner with Paul and Victor, following in-depth market research and consulting with industry insiders and experts. They realized the opportunity was way more enormous than they could have imagined. At that point, the idea transformed into Bond Intelligence Inc. As the plan began to unfold, Ajit needed additional help in data science and machine learning. Ajit reached out to a longtime friend Ani from Oppenheimer funds, who at the time, enrolled in a postgraduate data science program at the University of Washington. Ani would connect Ajit with Julius from the business school and Franky from the data science program. Ajit collaborated with Dr. Tim Leung at Computational Finance and Risk Management and wall street veteran Barnet Sherman on the Fixed Income Markets. Eventually, experts and industry insiders Tim, Barnet, Marc, Murali, Abhi, Mike and Dipit would join Bond Intelligence Inc.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Values</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Fairness, Transparency, and Honesty.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Establishing Trust</h2>
<p>We are a team of finance professionals, engineers, and data scientists, and we hold the products we craft to the highest standard. We believe that the most valuable insights must derive from the market, behavioral, fundamental, and alternative data by applying technologies such as artificial intelligence and simulation at the intersection of different disciplines. Data is a means to improving trust in the market. Trust is the currency of engagement. We strongly believe that exceptionally engineered predictive models, artificial intelligence, simulation, real-time SSBIT, and algorithmic pricing — not marble office buildings on Wall St — are the cornerstones of establishing trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Simplicity</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today there is a complex system of regulation, closed financial institutions, and inaccessible securities information that can seem daunting to a trader or investor who is trying to evaluate a fixed income instrument. Investment firms are looking for alternative analysis, seeking differentiated Insights. Making evaluation simple, focused, and immediately apparent and walking through the complete decision-making and trading process is hard work. But we believe that by sticking to this goal, we can make something extraordinary for traders and investors to unlock the gains from untapped </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alpha</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
