	<div class="entry-content">
<p>After working for over a decade in a few of the world’s largest financial institutions such as Bank of America, American Express (brokerage), Goldman Sachs, and a few stints at startups, Ajit began to realize how far behind the fixed income market was in adopting modern technology. Ajit started brainstorming with longtime friends from the industry and quickly zeroed in on the lack of high-quality research and expensive trading as the biggest problem. The fixed-income market is complex, inefficient, and opaque. It remains spreadsheet-driven and dominated by over-the-counter trades. The inefficiency and anomalies in the market are due to the lack of an integrated system, lack of predictive analytics, and the lack of optimized trade-matching, which ultimately lowers the trust.</p>
<p>The idea to integrate fixed income data and research was seeded. It was the one idea that would keep Ajit awake at night. It would not leave him alone, and the startup was born to facilitate data consolidation and research. Ajit realized that the real impact of technology would be on the trades in the secondary market on Wall Street. Now Ajit needed more resources for Big Data and Machine Learning, which lead him to reach out and partner with Paul and Victor, following in-depth market research and consulting with industry insiders and experts. They realized the opportunity was way more enormous than they could have imagined. As the plan began to unfold, Ajit needed additional help in data science and machine learning. Ajit reached out to a longtime friend Ani from Oppenheimer funds, who at the time, enrolled in a postgraduate data science program at the University of Washington. Ani would connect Ajit with Julius from the business school and Franky from the data science program. Ajit collaborated with Dr. Tim Leung at Computational Finance and Risk Management and wall street veteran Barnet Sherman on the Fixed Income Markets. Eventually, experts and industry insiders Tim, Barnet, Marc, Murali, Abhi, Mike and Dipit would join.</p>

<p>We are a team of finance professionals, engineers, and data scientists, and we hold the products we craft to the highest standard.
